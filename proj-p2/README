To run a specific test program, change to the scripts directory and run "perl compiler.pl ../include/program.txt", where program.txt can be changed to other test programs within the include directory. Next, return to the root directory of the project that includes makefile and run "make simg".

To test illegal instructions, copy include/imem_... to the root directory and rename to imem.fill.

The current status of this part of the project is that the processor is fully completed and verified.
