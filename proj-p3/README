README
------

1. Update AUTHORS file, add your firstname and LastName as -
   FirstName1_LastName1
   
   If multiple authors, list individual authors in separate lines as - 
   FirstName1_LastName1
   FirstName2_LastName2
   
   Avoid spaces in the name, use underscore (_) to separate different name-words.
   The script is designed to select only first-part before the space as the name.

2. Read makefile carefully before using.

3. "make clean" command will delete all the temporary files created during the simulation.
   It will delete all .log in the directory where makefile is located. 
   Keep all your reports in reports/ otherwise if they are in the directory of makefile, it will be deleted.
  
4. Use "make submit" command to create the final submission. The command will create the tar-ball, it will
   be named based on AUTHORS file. It will first perform "make clean" to remove simulation generated files 
   before creating the tar-file, this reduces the size of submission. 
   
   You can test your submission with "tar tvf  <TarFile> " command. 
   This lists all the files included in tar-file. 
   If you want to extract and test, the first create a temp directory to avoid overwriting existing files. 
   For example- 
   mkdir tar_temp
   tar xvf <TarFile> -C ./tar_temp/
   The tar-file will be extracted in tar_temp directory.
