Our first lec run had many non-equivalences. The step we took to debug this were:
1) Try performing lec on individual modules - isolated ALU
2) Replace Designware 2-stage multiplier with our own multiplier
3) This fixed all non-equivalences, but created abort points
4) Try many different options within lec and try allowing lec to run longer
5) Read conformal user-guide about abort points
6) Try hierarchical compare, which resolved abort points
